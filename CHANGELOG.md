# Changelog
- Bugfix: Enforce stricter H2 derivative import limit to avoid that exports of one type of derivative compensate for imports of another
- Added an option to source mobility demand from UBA MWMS (Projektionsbericht 2025) for the years 2025-2035
- Renamed functions and script for exogenous mobility demand
- Improved the transport demand data, added an option to source 2020 and 2025 data from AGEB instead of Aladin
- Added a helper function to change the weather_year to build_scenario
- Longer lifetime (40 years) is only applied to existing gas CHPs, not new ones. Added a new config entry `existing_capacities:fill_value_gas_chp_lifetime`
- Bugfix: gas CHPs are extendable again
- Simplified scenarion definition and made `Mix` the default scenario
- 0.3: workflow is all public now, no longer requires credentials to internal data
- Allowing myopic optimization until 2050
- CHP plants located in onshore regions without district heating are represented as EOP plants
- updating technology cost data to v0.11.0
- add option for Offhsore NEP to delay projects by x years (CurPol and KN2045minus_WorstCase are delayed by one year)
- Force onwind south by increasing minimum capacity and decreasing capacity per sqkm
- Adjusting aviation demand (from Aladin) and emission accounting (only domestic aviation for national target)
- Increase HVC_environment_sequestration_fraction from 0.1 to 0.6
- Disallow HVC to air in DE
- Restricting the maximum capacity of CurrentPolicies and minus scenarios to the 'uba Projektionsbericht'
- Restricting Fischer Tropsch capacity addition with config[solving][limit_DE_FT_cap]
- Except for Current Policies force a minimum of 5 GW of electrolysis capacity in Germany
- limit the import/export limit to/from Germany
- adjusting capacity factor of solar to match historic data
- Rely on DEA investment costs for electrolysis
- updated the Kernnetz to use latest data and operate it more flexible
- added Italy with 3 additional nodes
- adapted spatial distribution of district heating demand in Germany according to data from eGo^N project
- add retrofit of gas turbines to H2, and H2 turbines
- unravel gas bus and turn off gas network
